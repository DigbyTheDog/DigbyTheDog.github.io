         I went to Yellowstone National Park recently and I figured I would post about my experience here. This is sort of a blog, after all. I maintain a separate journal for private use, and even though nobody reads this, I figured that for long thoughts on a specific subject that I wouldn't mind being public, this is a good place to post. Alanis and I drove to Yellowstone in my car. In all, we drove about 3,500 miles.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         I decided that for this trip, I was going to take a lot of photos. I tend to take very littles photos of what I'm up to, and I would like to try and change that. So I took plenty of photos and uploaded my favorites to my Instagram, which there's a link to if you scroll down.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         As for stops along the way on our road trip, we did most of the exciting stuff on the way there to allow us to mostly focus on driving home on the drive back. We split the drive from Michigan to Wyoming into three days. On the first day, we stopped to get lunch at a nice rooftop restaurant at Navy Pier in Chicago. Afterward we ate a fancy churro sundae. It was the beginning of a trend of eating too much crazy food that would persist for the rest of the trip. After that, we visited "Cave of the Mounds", which is a limestone cave system in Wisconsin. That was... fine, too. We stayed the night either at the end of Wisconsin or the beginning of Minnesota. I had tried to reserve a room somewhere decent, but Expedia fucking sucks, so we ended up staying at a really sketchy Super 8 motel. It was a bad scene there, a lot of unsavory-looking fellows. Additionally, Expedia gave me a really hard time getting a refund. I called their customer support and they called me back at midnight. I did get my refund, and I was so exhausted I did manage to get some sleep despite the loud and unsettling surroundings. Overall, it was an ominous first night of our trip.
        <br/>
         <br/>
         Thankfully, this was about the only thing that went wrong for the entire rest of our vacation. Day two was a chiller day and there were fewer interesting stops for us to make. A really silly one that I made a point to stop at was a giant statue of the jolly green giant, as seen on canned and frozen vegetables. Really, the main reason I stopped here was to get a funny photo with the statue. After this, we stopped at "Devil's Gulch," a scenic park where, as legend has it, the outlaw Jesse James jumped his horse over the gulch to escape the law. We also found a GeoCache here. We had planned to do a lot of GeoCaching on our trip, but we sort of discovered that the entire states of South Dakota and Wyoming lack cellular reception. At least we found one, though!
