         I don't really know what's going on with this one. I originally doodled this person in colored pencils when I was bored working in a tool booth. In situations like that, I mostly just like to draw faces. As a side note, this is my first test of my new Python posting tool with an embedded image from imgur. If you're reading this, then it worked!
