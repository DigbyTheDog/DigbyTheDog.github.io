         Alanis and I found new jobs and moved to San Francisco. We wanted to move to a more happenin' city, and we ended up choosing San Francisco for its beauty, walkability, weather, and public transportation.
      </p>
      <p>
         We opted for the approach of taking whatever we could easily fit in our car only, selling and donating any large furniture, and getting rid of anything we did not need. This made packing pretty easy. Selling furniture and other items on Facebook Marketplace was more difficult than we thought. So many people message you and they are not often easy to work with. Alanis did most of that. 
      </p>
      <p>
         The road trip went mostly without issue. The day before we left we damaged the car a bit by hitting a large decorative boulder on my dad's front lawn. He recommended that I park there. Otherwise, it went exactly as planned. We took the I-80. Our route involved stopping for three nights before reaching our final destination. 
      </p>
      <p>
         During the first night, we slept in Omaha, Nebraska. This was a pretty boring drive, the midwestern scenery is very similar to what I've seen my whole life in Michigan. We were stuck in traffic and heavy rain for much of the day. Our hotel in Omaha was in kind of a weird spot, it felt like we were staying in a big trendy mall. We liked it, it was very comfortable and convenient.
      </p>
      <p>
         On the second night, we slept in Rawlins, Wyoming. This was maybe the least memorable day of the road trip for me. At least the scenery in Wyoming was beginning to get more mountainous and interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
         On the third day we made it further west than either of us had ever seen before. We drove through Utah, and were very impressed with the salt flats. It took us a long time to even understand what we were looking at. Our hotel for the night was in Winnemucca, Nevada. It was... uh... a lot of these towns off of the highway in Nevada have a bit of a depressing feel to me. A lot of casinos, a lot of pawn shops next to the casinos, everything in general is just a little horrible. Our hotel turned out to be a motel for a casino. We did not gamble at the casino. This was the least nice place we slept during the trip, but it still wasn't too bad at all. It was worse than I thought, and I was not expecting a motel. The reviews were quite good which may have given me expectations that were too high, but it's possible in hindsight that the reviews were more for the casino than for the motel. General thoughts from Alanis: "Nevada in general is pretty fucked up. It's dry and it looks like another planet. They had a surprisingly good Korean restaurant in Winnemucca. Everything was way more expensive than expected for being in the middle of nowhere."
      </p>
      <p>
         On the fourth and final day, we drove from Winnemucca to Emeryville, California. This was, by far, the shortest drive, and we were very thankful to make it here in one piece. I was initially nervous to enter the state of California because I have heard of their "agricultural checkpoints" where they inspect any plants and produce that you are bringing into the state, and we were traveling with a bonsai tree that we are fond of. I really didn't want to have to leave that behind. The bit of worrying was a total waste of time, though, there was nobody at the checkpoint anyway. Entering California on the I-80, you have to drive through a very mountainous forest area. It was beautiful, and a bit scary to drive through. In my opinion, it was worth it. Emeryville, not unlike the part of Omaha we saw, gives you the feeling that you are in a giant mall. But if Omaha felt like a trendy, luxurious mall, Emeryville feels a bit more like a dying strip mall. Nevertheless, our hotel was fantastic, and we were a short and convenient walk to a grocery store, numerous good restaurants, and a bus stop that would take us to San Francisco. We had made it!
      </p>

         Our cat, Milhouse, mostly did well on the road trip. We gave him a nice little space in the back seat, but he was a bit stressed out, so he mostly slept the whole time in the car. He did okay at the hotels for the most part, too, but he did keep us awake for an hour or two each night by meowing. We were pretty worried about his stress, but in the end it turned out okay.

         The Thursday after we arrived, we explored neighborhoods that we had researched and found that we would most likely want to live. Nob Hill, Russian Hill, North Beach, and Pacific Heights were all top contenders. If we had any doubts about this move (and staying in Emeryville, I did have doubts,) they were eradicated that day; We walked for miles and explored a beautiful, vibrant city. Walking around these neighborhoods was also very useful for us in making a decision on an apartment later.
      </p>
      <p>
         To help us in finding an apartment, we hired the company Move Bay Area. We really liked our experience with them. We let them know our priorities and budget, as well as our preferred neighborhoods, and they found 10-15 apartments for us to tour, set up viewings, and drove us around. Being able to be driven around and see so many apartments on the same day was fantastic. There were many good options in our price range, too. There were difficulties in finding apartments here, though. For one thing, we had the hard requirements of "cat-friendly" and "convenient parking very close." This instantly eliminates probably 80% of our options. We did not previously understand how difficult this combination was to come by. Another difficulty is unclear apartment listings on Zillow and other such platforms; In some cases they downright lie. "One bedroom" can sometimes mean "studio" and "Lower Nob Hill" can sometimes mean "Tenderloin." Also, a Zillow listing can look beautiful, but they do not disclose that it is an "add-on" unit and is basically half underground. We ended up in a beautiful spot in the end, though. The apartment itself is a bit janky, but it's spacious enough, in an awesome location, cat-friendly, and has a parking garage. We will make it beautiful soon, too, and then it will be perfect.

         We had never visited San Francisco prior to moving here. Even though we had done a ton of research, of course it differed from our expectations just a bit. For example, Alanis thought there would be more big skyscrapers. Since Chicago is the most major American city she had been to before, that might have changed her expectations. She knew that there were Edwardian and Victorian homes of course, but she thought that those would be vastly outnumbered by large buildings. For me, everything was mostly as expected, but some things don't quite register properly when you read them or see them in photos compared to when you experience them in real life. For example, the steep, hilly terrain is way more beautiful in person than photos portray. Also, everything I had read told me that this is a cold city, so I knew that, but I am still surprised by it anyway. Next, I have seen and heard many people describe this as a place that is "dying" or "dead" in recent years, that I was surprised by how lively it is. To anybody who says that it's a dead city, I would recommend spending some time in almost any other place in the country. And of course, no matter how much you read about the homeless problem, it can never prepare you for the sad things that you can see around. This whole trip and move has been quite a bit more expensive than we thought, too, but we are well-prepared for it anyway.

         So far, nothing has indicated to us that we are making any kind of mistake. Our new jobs are the last uncertainty ahead of us, and even in the slim chance that those do not work for us, we are surrounded by opportunity here. We have a huge checklist of things to do and see in this city, and most everything I see here puts me in a good mood. This has been a lot of work and a lot of fun!!!
