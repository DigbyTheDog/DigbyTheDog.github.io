         I did finish the "My First Game Jam", which was indeed my first game jam, and my game... more or less came out the way I wanted it to? I would call it "finished." I should have spent a lot more time on it, though. I would say, in all, I spent fewer than 10 hours on it over the course of the two week jam. I did learn some useful things, such as the importance of creating a "scene switcher" scene in Godot so you can pass data in between levels, as well as some important things to look out for when setting up the controls for a local multiplayer game. I had implemented multiplayer and had to cut it out at the last minute, because the controls were not behaving correctly in all cases. I wanted for one-player mode to involve the player controlling both eyes, and two-player mode involve each player controlling one eye, but I found out, 2 hours before the game jam ended, that my controls were buggy, so I figured the easiest solution was to remove multiplayer. The game can be downloaded from this <a href="https://digbythedog.itch.io/crybaby"><b>very not-decorated page.</b></a> It's not the most interesting game, but I did what I set out to and learned a bit about Godot and game development in the process. Here's to many more game jams!
