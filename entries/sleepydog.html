         This is a little sleeping dog. The scene is made in Blender and I imported the drawings of the dogs as planes. There is a lot that makes me annoyed about this like the fact that his snot bubble is going the wrong way. And why the fuuuuuuck is one of the keys on that keyboard disappearing? But overall this was just supposed to be a little test of using 2D animations in 3D spaces in Blender, and I learned from it, so I can't complain too much.
