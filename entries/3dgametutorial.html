         I had recently made my first little game in Godot for a game jam, but I had done that entirely by teaching myself as I went, which resulted in a pretty horribly set up project. I recently followed a YouTube tutorial on how to make a 3D game, and I learned a lot from it. Pardon the tiny gif. The tutorial is a couple of years old, but surprisingly, almost all of it was still correct and relevant. I feel much more confident in my ability to use Godot now, and I even learned a bit of Blender-to-Godot workflow.
