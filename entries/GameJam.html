         Despite my healing eyes, I am attempting to participate in Itch.Io's "My First Game Jam: Winter 2022 Edition," which is a beginner-friendly Game Jam lasting 15 days, from January 15th to January 30th. I missed the first several days of the jam, unfortunately, due to my eyes healing from PRK surgery. I decided that my game will be based on eyes, for that reason. I will attempt to make, in Godot, a space shooter called "CryBaby", where you control a pair of eyes who shoots tears as projectiles at oncoming razor blade enemies. The gameplay will be similar to Space Invaders, with the player trying to protect the pair of disembodied eyes in space. I am a little skeptical that I can actually finish this in the 10 days that I have left, as I feel that I've barely started, but I will be updating with more posts as I progress. So far, I only have the shooting controls, and they still aren't finished. I will submit something, and hopefully it will be a finished product, whether it's any good or not.
