         I created a little Python implementation of the game Hunt the Wumpus. It's a simplified version of the game based on the popular web version I found. The code is kind of bad! But it works I think. I had just finished a book about Python so I was excited to make a little something with it. You can download it and play it by <a href="downloads/wumpus_text.zip"><b>clicking here.</b></a> This is also my first post of the new year, so happy new year! I haven't done enough but I'm glad I've stuck with this website for about a year now.
