         In my latest weak excuse to write code in my free time, I have made a little tool to help me practice Spanish, something I've been doing for the past couple of weeks. It connects to a file that has a list of sentence fragments in English that are categorized. It then shuffles these based on which category you selected, and gives you a random English sentence fragment, with which you are tasked with writing a sentence with the equivalent phrase in Spanish. The sentence is then sent to the website DeepL via DeepL's REST API, and displayed so that you can confirm that you wrote what you thought you just wrote. My reason for using DeepL is that my Spanish instructor recommended it as an alternative for Google translate. The tool is written in Python, and because it uses the DeepL API, I do have to pay a small monthly fee to use it.
