         I've been teaching myself Godot, a popular open-source game development engine. I've chosen to focus on Godot instead of learning Unity or Unreal because, despite it being a bit less powerful and lacking a bit more in learning resources, it seems to have a cleaner and easier-to-understand interface. It seems that it's a bit easier to get started with Godot, and the scene/node-based system is immediately intuitive to me. Besides, it seems best suited for the simple and quick things I'd like to make. My biggest worry with Godot is that I may not be able to do the 3D things that I want to, or incorporate Blender into my workflow, but 3D is at least possible with Godot, so it should hopefully be fine.

         I think it's best with these things to start by ripping off very simple and very famous games. I started by making a perfectly-functioning and fairly nice-looking implementation of Pong, which I was pretty happy with. I then started working on Asteroids. I programmed the player ship, complete with its rotation and famous intertia, and asteroid generation, but after that I got bored and did not finish. Finally, I started work on a Dragon Quest 1 ripoff game starring a little cat, who is based off of my cat Milhouse. I am spending a lot more time on this one compared to the other two, it seems. I spent way too much time making customizable/flexible menus to be used throughout the game, but I think I might have to scrap them, unfortunately, and start over. Part of the learning process, I guess.

         For my little Dragon Quest game, I am making pixel art for the overworld. I am using Aesprite, which is a 20 dollar pixel art drawing tool that I recently bought and enjoy a ton. It's extremely easy to use and fun to play around in. It reminds me a lot of Pico-8, in its cuteness. Here is a little cat walk animation I made.
