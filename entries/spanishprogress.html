         I have been teaching myself Spanish this year and I thought I would post about my progress. Initially, I was paying for private Spanish lessons on a website called italki. While I think this is a great tool, I don't think it was appropriate for where I was at the time. It was expensive, and ultimately, I knew so little about the language that I was learning things that were pretty much the basic foundations that you can find online. I think that the italki tool is more appropriate when you have a baseline knowledge and can begin to form some semblance of a conversation. So, I decided to stop italki for now until I have a stronger grasp on the fundamentals. Currently, I have a daily routine that consists of about one hour, which I usually do during my lunch break. First, I listen to a channel on YouTube called "Language Transfer", which I find to be extremely informative. They are about 10-minute-long videos that center around transferring your existing knowledge of English into Spanish, with an emphasis on explaining how differences in language illustrate different ways of thinking. I follow that with Duolingo, which I usually use for about 20-30 minutes. During Language Transfer and Duolingo, I'll usually add new vocabulary, phrases, and sentences, to my Spanish-learning python tool, which I've posted about previously. After Language Transfer and Duolingo, I test myself by writing sentences using that tool for about 20 minutes. I think that this routine has been working for me lately. I think I am nearly approaching a point in which I will go back to italki in addition to my existing routine. I hope that the end of next year, I will be able to have proper conversations with my wife in Spanish.
