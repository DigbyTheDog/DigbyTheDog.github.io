         I recently got photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) surgery to correct my vision, and I figured that I ought to make a post about it here to preserve my immediate thoughts. I've wanted to get LASIK for years, with fear and money concerns keeping me away from it. However, I have heard that often, surgeons are hesitant to give the surgery to older patients, so I figured that there's no better time than now. I got my initial consultation way back in August, and was told that my corneas were too thin for LASIK, so I would need to get PRK instead. The difference is that the healing process is much, much slower compared to LASIK. I would need to take a week off of work, which is why I waited all the way until January 13th, 2022, so that I would have enough paid time off at work to recover. One week later, I have no regrets at all about the surgery, and think it was the best $4,898 dollars I've ever spent. By now, my eyesight is probably just a little bit worse than it was when I had glasses, but my understanding is that it will continue to improve. My left eye feels almost perfect, whereas my right eye feels a bit more blurry. My right eye felt perfect, too, but yesterday I took out the bandage contact lenses that were protecting my eyes for a week, and had a slight decrease in clarity after that, which is apparently normal.

         The surgery itself was scary, but over with very quickly. Alanis drove me there, and waited while the procedure was done, and got to watch from outside the surgery room. They had me lay down and stare at a green light directly above me. They gave me a little foam basketball to hold onto and squeeze, which turned out to come in handy, because it was a pretty stressful five minutes. You can smell the tissue that they're burning, you can see your vision changing rapidly, and you can hear the team of doctors talking to each other and counting, and the clicking of the tools that they use. After that, Alanis drove me home, and I took a nap.

         My first week of healing seems like it was pretty typical when compared to what most people experience. Vision came and went, as did discomfort. The worst day for me was the third day, which is once again typical to the experience of most people. I had to be careful not to rub my eyes, wear these big dorky sunglasses when I slept or went outside, and put in 4 different eyedrops several times per day. My eyesight was too bad to look at anything for 5 days, so I listened to a ton of podcasts and a couple of audiobooks. Retronauts, Talking Simpsons, We Hate Movies, and Podcast: The Ride were my podcasts of choice, and I listened to Cat's Cradle and Breakfast of Champions, both by Kurt Vonnegut, on Audible.

         I'm still healing, and my vision is still changing, but by now, I can drive, look at my phone, watch television, work, and all other normal things that people do. Maybe I'll make another post in a few months when I hopefully have 100% perfect vision.
