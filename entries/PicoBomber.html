         My first Pico-8 game, a clone of Bomberman, can be played by <a href="games/pico-bomber/mygame.html"><b>clicking here.</b></a> 
         There are only two stages, and there are bugs if you either beat the second stage or get a "Game Over" on it. 
         Maybe I'll fix these at some point, but I'm pretty happy with it generally, and I learned a lot.
