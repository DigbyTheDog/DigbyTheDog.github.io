         Happy Fourth of July! It's been ages since I've posted here.

         I've made a little... game! It was meant to be another virtual pet game, but it sort of fell through. But you can see what I ended up with by <a href="https://digbythedog.itch.io/family-forest"><b>clicking here!</b></a>
      </p>

         This was planned to be similar to the "Chum Garden" idea from a previous post. Basically, you want plant a tree, and choose (via buttons) how you spent time with your tree when it's growing up. Depending on what choices you make, the type of tree would change, and it would have different facial features to reflect how it was raised. Adult trees would then drop an acorn, and the next tree you raise has both genetic traits from its parent tree as well as environmental traits from how you raise it.
      </p>
      <p>
         In the end, you just drop an acorn into the ground and a tree with a random face appears. I spent about 15 hours making this, including drawing and scanning all of the facial features.
