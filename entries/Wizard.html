         Just a little RPG-inspired drawing. I really like turn-based RPGs in theory only. It seems like if they're old and crusty enough, I can enjoy them a little more, such as the first generation of Pokemon, or Mother 1. It's almost as though I pity them for being so primitive and flawed. I'm flawed, too, little old RPG, don't you worry about it, ok?
