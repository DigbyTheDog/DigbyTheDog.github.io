         I made this site (with the help of StyleShout, who made the template and CSS,) to track the progress of my personal projects. The primary purpose is to encourage me to continue to try new things and post about it. The secondary purpose is that I've owned the lexleesch.com domain for years and it has always been pointing nowhere. The site is a work in progress. As of the time I'm writing this, the content tags and categories in the sidebar do not work. I have the pages and search mostly working. The social media links at the bottom only link to those websites, and not my profile, as a joke. Ha. Ha. Ha.
