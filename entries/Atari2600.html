         Lately, I have been tinkering with programming for the Atari 2600 using assembly language. I followed a really good course on Udemy. I (re)learned a lot about assembly language as well as the unique constraints of the 6502 processor and TIA chip. I also gained a lot of respect for developers and designers back in the day who used to work under these constraints. It really seems to me like the Atari 2600/VCS was really only designed with games like Pong and Combat in mind. You get two characters, two missiles, and a ball. Any entities beyond that requires trickery. In fact, even a game like Pong seems to require some trickery with such a basic task as displaying the score. To program for the Atari, you really need a solid understanding of the hardware. Beyond finishing the course, I made a little "sound test" program, nothing impressive. I had sketched out a game earlier with the intention of finishing it, but I might come back to it later, I'm a bit burnt out on the assembly programming. I'm not sure if it's something I have that much patience for, but I would like to try it again some time. It's an interesting change of pace, and I find that the smallest accomplishment feels like a big deal. It's something I could easily get sucked into for long periods of time.
