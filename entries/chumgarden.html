         Chum Garden is an unfinished game that I started, intending to release it for the 2022 "InspireJam" Game Jam. The gameplay would have been heavily inspired by the Chao Garden feature from the Sonic Adventure games. Your Chum starts as an egg, and depending on how you spend time with your Chum, statistics about him would change. Every time an action is taken, one hour of the day passes. I had the most fun creating the pixel art, which was done in Aseprite, which is a really neat tool for drawing sprites.
